# Solution
 - Time complexity: O(N*M) ** N: The number of values in a row / N: The number of rows
 - If the values that are needed to be flipped are same, the values will not be changed.
 - If the values that are needed to be flipped are different, the values will be changed.
 - If the number of the values in a row is odd, the value in the mittle will be changed.
